<h2 id="the-community-management-app">The community management app</h2>
<p>My first goal with Commune is to understand how to articulate the different Android components, the <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> protocol, and manage event planning as well. Weâ€™ll see where it goes from there.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal is the far future is to create an open-source tool to manage communities of various size. Just one app to communicate with your friends, coworkers, co-citizens, etc.<br>
Send a simple message, create a group chat, plan an event and share some interesting stuff.</p>
